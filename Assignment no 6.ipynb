    "In object-oriented programming we combine the group of related variables and functions into a unit we call that unit an        object we refer to this variable as properties and the functions as methods e.g: let’s assume that  “ bike” is an object        with properties such as colour , make  and model functions like start, stop and  move . so it is not new language or            anything different from code  it just smarter way to write a program.
